<h1 align="left">What is Tinyscraper?</h1>

Tinyscraper is a Python package that is designed to help with scraping post data from imageboards built using Tinyboard (and Tinyboard forks, such as vichan, etc.) for corpus analysis. Tinyscraper aims to be a helpful tool for both people familiar with building web scraping tools, and people who are not familiar/comfortable with working in Python.
