# The Project

Tinyscraper is a Python package that is designed to help with scraping post data from imageboards built using Tinyboard (and Tinyboard forks, such as vichan, etc.) for corpus analysis. Tinyscraper aims to be a helpful tool for both people familiar with building webscraping tools, and people who are not familiar/comfortable with working in Python.
